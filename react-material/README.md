## Setup

To set up a React project with Material-UI, using Node.js version 14, you need to follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrickMMO/template-frontend.git
cd react-material
```
````

### 2. Install Node.js Version 14

Ensure that you have Node.js version 14 installed. You can check your current Node.js version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js version 14 installed, you can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/).

**Note:** If you already have Node.js installed but want to use a different version, you can use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to manage multiple Node.js versions. Install `nvm` from the [official nvm repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then run the following commands:

```bash
nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

### 3. Install Node Modules

Install the required node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Open the Project in the Browser

Open the project in the browser: `http://localhost:3000`.
